This is just a wrapper around the built-in Resque web monitoring to allow password protection which is configurable through wolf_core. The app itself is defined within the wolf_core gem (resque_app.rb), and this repository simply holds the Gemfile and configs for passenger, apache, and capistrano. It allows you to check Resque stats, running & failed jobs, and active queues via a web interface and includes integration with resque-scheduler. The password protection is done with HTTP basic auth, and the username and password can be set in the main wolf_core.yml under the settings "resque_user" and "resque_pwd".
